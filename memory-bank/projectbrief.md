# Project Brief: Azure DevOps MCP Server

## Overview
The Azure DevOps MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol server implementation that provides seamless integration with Azure DevOps services. It enables AI agents to interact with Azure DevOps projects, repositories, work items, and pull requests through a standardized interface.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement MCP server specification for Azure DevOps integration
2. Provide tools for core Azure DevOps operations:
   - Organization management
   - Project management
   - Repository operations
   - Work item tracking
   - Pull request handling

## Goals
- Enable seamless Azure DevOps integration for AI agents
- Provide type-safe interfaces for all operations
- Maintain comprehensive error handling
- Support multiple authentication methods
- Ensure robust test coverage
- Deliver clear documentation

## Success Criteria
- All core Azure DevOps operations are accessible via MCP tools
- Authentication works reliably with multiple methods
- Operations have proper error handling and validation
- Integration tests verify real-world usage
- Documentation covers setup and all features

## Constraints
- Must follow MCP server specification
- Must handle Azure DevOps API rate limits
- Must support enterprise security requirements
- Must maintain backward compatibility
