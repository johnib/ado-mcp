# Project Brief: Azure DevOps MCP Server

## Overview
The Azure DevOps MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol implementation that enables AI assistants to interact with Azure DevOps APIs through a standardized protocol. This server acts as a bridge between AI models and Azure DevOps resources, providing secure and efficient access to projects, work items, repositories, and more.

## Core Requirements

### Functionality
- MCP protocol compliance for standardized AI communication
- Comprehensive Azure DevOps API integration
- Multiple authentication method support (PAT, AAD)
- Secure credential handling and access control
- End-to-end workflow support (user story to pull request)

### Tools
1. **Core Navigation**
   - List organizations
   - List projects
   - List repositories

2. **Work Item Management**
   - Create/update work items
   - Query and list work items
   - Track work item status

3. **Repository Operations**
   - Access repository contents
   - Manage branches and pull requests
   - Handle file operations

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript/Node.js implementation
- MCP SDK integration
- Azure DevOps Node API client
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Clear documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
1. Complete tool implementation with test coverage
2. Secure authentication and credential management
3. Efficient API interaction with proper error handling
4. Clear documentation and usage examples
5. Successful integration with AI assistants (e.g., Claude)

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Core MCP server implementation
- Azure DevOps API integration
- Authentication methods (PAT, AAD)
- Tool implementation for common operations
- Documentation and examples
- Testing and security measures

### Out of Scope
- Custom Azure DevOps extensions
- UI components or frontends
- Direct database access
- Third-party integrations beyond Azure DevOps

## Risk Assessment
1. **Authentication Complexity**
   - Multiple auth methods increase complexity
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and examples

2. **API Limitations**
   - Rate limits and API constraints
   - Mitigation: Implement proper error handling and retry logic

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Credential management and access control
   - Mitigation: Follow security best practices, use secure storage

## Timeline and Milestones
1. **Foundation (Complete)**
   - Basic server setup
   - Authentication implementation
   - Core tool structure

2. **Development (In Progress)**
   - Tool implementation
   - Testing framework
   - Documentation

3. **Future Work**
   - Additional tool support
   - Performance optimizations
   - Extended authentication methods

## Project Status
Current implementation provides a solid foundation with core tools and authentication methods in place. Future work will focus on expanding tool coverage and enhancing features based on user needs.
